===================================
Upload portal of the c-VEDA project
===================================

Neuroimaging data is uploaded by acquisition centres to the upload portal,
for further processing by the databank team.

The upload portal is part of `c-VEDA databank operations`_ but the source code
lives in its own repository. It is a Python module, based on PIWS_ / rql_upload_,
which in turn are based on CubicWeb_.
